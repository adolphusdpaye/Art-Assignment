    <h1>What is a loren ipsum?</h1>
    <strong>loam ipsum</strong></u>is simply dommy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<u>
loan ipsum</u> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
printer took a galley of type snd scramble it to make a type specimen book. it has survived 
not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, reamining essentially 
unchange. it was popularised in the 1960s, with the release of letreset sheetsc contaning loten 
ipsum passages, and most recently with desktop publishing software like<em><strong><u>Aldus 
pagemaker</u></strong></em>including versions of lorem. ipsum.<font font-text="arial narrow"color="black">

         <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
            <p> it is a long established fact a reader wwill be distracted by the 
             readable contnent of a page when looking at its layout. The point of 
             using <u>lorem ipsum</u>is that it has a more- or-less normal disstribution
             of using <q> content here, </q>, making it look like readable english.
             Many desktop publishing package and web page editors now use loem ipsum
             as their defult model text, and a serch for "loren ipsum"will uncover many 
             web sites still in their infancy. Various versions envolve over the years,
             sometimes by accident, sometime on purpose(injected humour and the like).
            
             <h1> Where can I get some?</h1>
                <strong> there are many variatiions of passages if lorem ipsum available, but the majority have suffered 
                 alteretion in some form, by injected humour, or<u> randomized words</u> wich don't look even slightly
                believable.</strong> if you are going to use a passage of lorem ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.<em>All the lorem ipsum generator on the internet 
                tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary. making this first true generator on the internet</em>.
               It uses a dictionary of over 200 latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
               to generate larem ipsum which looks reasonasble. The generated lorem ipsum is therefore always free 
               from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
